## A flashy introduction to the C++17 standard

In this short presentation, I go through some of the main new features of the C++17 standard, trying to give an example for every described aspect.
The presentation is split into two parts: One about new language features and one about new library features.
For most of new standard aspects that are not discussed in the presentation, a link to the corresponding section on [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) is given, sometimes with some additional links.

In the **`Cpp`** folder most of examples contained in the slides are available e.g. to be played around with.
The slides compiled as PDF file are available as attached file to each release in [the release page](https://github.com/AxelKrypton/Cpp17-flashy-introduction/releases).

### Note about LaTeX compilation

If you wish to compile LaTeX source code, the `TeXnicalities` package and the used beamer theme are needed and can be found [here](https://github.com/AxelKrypton/TeXnicalities).

### Disclaimer

This material has been prepared to support work of my colleagues at Goethe University in Frankfurt and it is not meant to dive into technical details of the language, but rather be a first entry point about new features.
