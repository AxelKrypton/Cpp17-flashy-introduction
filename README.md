## A flashy introduction to the C++17 standard

In this short presentation, I go through some of the main new features of the C++17 standard, trying to give an example for every described aspect.
The presentation is split into two parts: One about new language features and one about new library features.
For most of new standard aspects that are not discussed in the presentation, a link to the corresponding section on [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) is given, sometimes with some additional links.

### Note

This material has been prepared to support work of my colleagues at Goethe University in Frankfurt and it is not meant to dive into technical details of the language, but rather be a first entry point about new features.
